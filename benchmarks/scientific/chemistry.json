Each water molecule can form up to 4 hydrogen bonds (2 as donor via its H atoms, 2 as acceptor via its lone pairs), creating a robust 3D hydrogen-bonded network. The other hydrides (H₂S, H₂Se, H₂Te) have much weaker intermolecular forces because S, Se, Te are larger and less electronegative, making hydrogen bonding negligible. Their boiling points follow the expected trend of increasing with molecular weight (London dispersion forces). Water is the anomaly, not the others.",

(6) Zaitsev's rule: the more substituted alkene (2-butene) is the major product. Trans-2-butene is preferred due to less steric strain in the anti-periplanar transition state.
