The only surviving contributions come from paths where S is stationary (δS = 0), which is precisely Hamilton's principle of classical mechanics. This is the stationary phase approximation: the integral is dominated by the classical path x_cl(t) satisfying the Euler-Lagrange equations. Quantum corrections appear as fluctuations around this classical path, suppressed by powers of ℏ. The leading correction gives the Van Vleck determinant: K ≈ √(det(-∂²S/∂x∂x')/(2πiℏ)) exp(iS_cl/ℏ).",
