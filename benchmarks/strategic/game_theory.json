Implications: No non-dictatorial, surjective voting system with 3+ candidates is immune to strategic voting. This is closely related to Arrow's impossibility theorem. Practical consequences: all real voting systems (plurality, Borda count, ranked choice, Condorcet methods) are manipulable. System designers must accept some degree of manipulability and choose systems where manipulation is computationally hard or requires precise information about others' preferences. Exceptions only arise in restricted domains (e.g., single-peaked preferences allow strategy-proof rules like median voter mechanisms).",
