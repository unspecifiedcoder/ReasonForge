Temperature role: at high T, accepts worse solutions freely (exploration). As T→0, only accepts improvements (exploitation). This allows escaping local optima, unlike hill climbing which always gets stuck. Cooling schedule: geometric (T' = αT, α ≈ 0.95), linear, logarithmic. Slower cooling → better solutions but more computation. Theoretically, logarithmic cooling (T_k = C/ln(k)) guarantees convergence to global optimum, but is impractically slow. Hill climbing is a special case of SA with T = 0: greedy, fast, but trapped by local optima. SA provides probabilistic guarantee of finding near-optimal solutions for NP-hard problems.",
