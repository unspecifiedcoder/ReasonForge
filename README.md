# 🧠 ReasonForge

> **Decentralized Verifiable Reasoning Infrastructure**

ReasonForge is a cutting-edge protocol designed to transform raw LLM output into **Verifiable Logic Traces**. In an era of black-box AI, ReasonForge provides a decentralized subnet structure where reasoning is not just generated, but forged, debated, and verified through a multi-agent consensus mechanism.

## ⚡ The Forging Lifecycle

ReasonForge operates on a sophisticated five-phase lifecycle to ensure maximum logical density and zero hallucination.

1.  **Task Dispatch**: The Subnet Generator creates high-difficulty reasoning challenges across Math, Code, Science, and Ethics.
2.  **Logic Mining**: Miner Nodes (e.g., `0xa3f7`) execute deep, multi-step reasoning chains, providing evidence for every logical leap.
3.  **Protocol Consensus**: Validators analyze the reasoning trace, scoring **Accuracy**, **Completeness**, and **Novelty** to derive a Composite Miner Score (CMS).
4.  **Adversarial Debate**: An AI adversary attempts to find subtle flaws in the logic, forcing the miner to provide a formal rebuttal.
5.  **Intelligence Synthesis**: Final verified logic is compiled into enterprise-grade reports for legal, financial, or scientific deployment.
