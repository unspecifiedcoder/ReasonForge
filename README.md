# 🧠 ReasonForge

**The Decentralized Marketplace for Verifiable Intelligence**  
*Where reasoning itself is the commodity.*

[🌐 Live Dashboard](https://reasonforge-app.vercel.app) • [🏗️ GitHub Source](https://github.com/unspecifiedcoder/ReasonForge) • [🚀 Deploy to Vercel](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Funspecifiedcoder%2FReasonForge)

### 🛡️ The Mission: Solving the Hallucination Crisis

**ReasonForge** is a cutting-edge protocol designed to transform raw LLM output into **Verifiable Logic Traces**. 

While current state-of-the-art models operate as opaque "black boxes" of probabilistic guessing (System 1), ReasonForge provides the infrastructure where reasoning is forged, debated, and mathematically verified through a multi-agent consensus mechanism. We move AI from *guessing* to *thinking* (System 2).

### ⚡ The Forging Lifecycle (Proof of Intelligence)

ReasonForge implements a genuine **Proof of Intelligence (PoI)** protocol, moving beyond simple compute-hashing into structured cognitive labor.

1.  **Task Dispatch**: The Subnet Generator samples high-difficulty challenges across Math, Code, Science, Strategy, Causal Inference, and Ethics.
2.  **Logic Mining**: Miner Nodes (e.g., `Miner_0xa3f7`) execute deep, multi-step reasoning chains. Every logical leap must be backed by evidence or formal proofs.
3.  **Hybrid Validation**:
    *   **Objective Scoring (60%)**: Automated verification via code sandboxes and formal checkers.
    *   **Consensus Scoring (40%)**: Stake-weighted validator median scoring of logical density and novelty.
4.  **Adversarial Debate**: A sub-protocol where AI adversaries attempt to find logical non-sequiturs, rewarding miners who provide verifiable rebuttals.
5.  **Intelligence Synthesis**: Final verified logic is compiled into enterprise-grade reports for high-stakes deployment in legal, financial, and scientific markets.

### 🚀 Getting Started

#### Installation
```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/unspecifiedcoder/ReasonForge.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd ReasonForge

# Install dependencies
npm install
```

#### Development
```bash
# Start the Vite development server
npm run dev
```

#### Configuration
To enable **Live Network** mode, provide a Gemini API key in `app.tsx`:
```javascript
const apiKey = "YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY";
```
*Defaults to **Simulation Mode** (internal mock reasoning engine) if the key is empty.*
