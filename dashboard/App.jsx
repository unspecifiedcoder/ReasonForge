/**
 * ReasonForge Dashboard — Standalone React Component
 * 
 * This is a copy of the main app.tsx dashboard for use as a standalone
 * single-file React component. It contains an embedded JS simulation engine
 * that ports all 13 whitepaper formulas, making it work without the Python API.
 * 
 * To use: import App from './dashboard/App.jsx' in a React project with recharts.
 * See the main app.tsx for the full TypeScript version.
 */

// This file mirrors app.tsx — see app.tsx for the canonical implementation.
// The standalone JSX version is maintained for demo/artifact purposes.
